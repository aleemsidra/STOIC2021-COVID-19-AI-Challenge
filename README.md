## Setup
To set up the project environment using conda, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: ```git@github.com:aleemsidra/STOIC2021-COVID-19-AI-Challenge.git```
2. Navigate to the project directory: ```cd training```
3. Create a conda environment: ```conda create --name stoic python=3.8```

## Example Code

```
python train.py
```

## Example Code

The proposed method secured fourth rank in final phase of the STOIC2021 - COVID-19 AI Challenge
